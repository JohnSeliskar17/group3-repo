                    A big part of losing weight is to eat healthier, which is often said to be difficult. Here at the Delaware Area Career Center, 
                    we want to help you eat as healthy as you can, while still having fun! This website is dedicated to help everyone change their diet for the better,

                    a perfect solution to making sure you don’t overeat. We also feature a page that informs you about the danger of alcohol,
                    and how you can stay safe while still having fun! We also have a page dedicated to letting you know what vegan options are available around popular restaurants, 
                    and our definitely trademarked “Fast VS Fresh” page, comparing the quality between fast food and homemade meals. </span></td>
